        <h2>DNS</h2>
        <p>DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. 
        Our domain resolves to multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, demonstrating redundancy and load balancing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>IP Addressing</h2>
        <p>The website resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. 
        IPv4 uses 32-bit addressing while IPv6 uses 128-bit addressing for larger address space.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>
        <p>This website uses HTTPS, which encrypts communication using TLS over TCP/IP. 
        HTTP traffic automatically redirects to HTTPS, ensuring secure communication.</p>
